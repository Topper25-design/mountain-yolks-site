# Formspree Setup Guide for Mountain Yolks Contact Form

This guide will help you set up Formspree for the contact form on your Mountain Yolks website.

## What is Formspree?

Formspree is a form backend service that allows you to receive form submissions via email without needing a server. It's perfect for static sites and Next.js applications.

**Free Plan Includes:**
- 50 submissions per month
- Email notifications
- Spam filtering
- No credit card required

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Formspree Account

1. Go to [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (or use Google/GitHub to sign in)
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create a New Form

1. Once logged in, click **"+ New Form"**
2. Give your form a name (e.g., "Mountain Yolks Contact Form")
3. Click **"Create Form"**
4. You'll be redirected to your form's dashboard

### Step 3: Get Your Form ID

On your form's dashboard, you'll see an endpoint URL like:
```
https://formspree.io/f/xvoeabcd
```

The part after `/f/` is your **Form ID** (e.g., `xvoeabcd`)

### Step 4: Configure Your Environment Variable

1. In your project root, create a file named `.env.local` (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your Form ID:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=xvoeabcd
```

Replace `xvoeabcd` with your actual Form ID.

**Important:** 
- `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to GitHub
- Use `.env.local.example` as a reference

### Step 5: Update the Contact Form (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to hardcode the endpoint instead of using environment variables:

1. Open `app/contact/page.tsx`
2. Find this line:
```typescript
const FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT = 'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID';
```
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Form ID:
```typescript
const FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT = 'https://formspree.io/f/xvoeabcd';
```

### Step 6: Test Your Form

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Navigate to the Contact page: `http://localhost:3000/contact`

3. Fill out and submit the test form

4. Check your Formspree dashboard - you should see the submission!

5. Check your email - you should receive a notification

## Formspree Dashboard Features

4. **Webhooks**: Integrate with other services

## Advanced: Using Environment Variables

We've set up the contact form to support environment variables. Here's how it works:

### Development (.env.local)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=xvoeabcd
```

### Production (Vercel/Netlify)
Add the environment variable in your hosting platform's settings:
- **Variable Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID`
- **Value**: Your Form ID (e.g., `xvoeabcd`)

## Upgrading Formspree

If you need more than 50 submissions per month:

- **Gold Plan** ($10/month): 1,000 submissions
- **Platinum Plan** ($40/month): 10,000 submissions
- **Custom Enterprise** plans available

## Alternative Services

If you prefer a different service, here are some alternatives:

1. **EmailJS** - Free tier: 200 emails/month
2. **Netlify Forms** - Free tier: 100 submissions/month (Netlify hosting required)
3. **Getform** - Free tier: 50 submissions/month
4. **Web3Forms** - Free, unlimited submissions

The contact form can be easily adapted to any of these services by changing the `FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` and adjusting the submission logic.

## Troubleshooting

### Form not submitting?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify your Form ID is correct
3. Check that environment variable is set (restart dev server after adding .env.local)
4. Ensure you're connected to the internet

### Not receiving emails?
1. Check your spam folder
2. Verify your email in Formspree settings
3. Check Formspree dashboard to see if submission was received
4. Add additional email addresses in form settings

### Getting CORS errors?
- Formspree should handle CORS automatically
- If issues persist, check Formspree form settings and allowed domains
